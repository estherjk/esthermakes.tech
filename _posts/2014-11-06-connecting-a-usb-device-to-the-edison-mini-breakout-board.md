## Introduction

In this post, we will connect a USB device to the Edison mini breakout board. If you haven't set up Edison yet, please go [here](/blog/2014-10-29-getting-started-with-intel-edison-on-os-x), then come back to this post.

## Supplies

These are the supplies you will need:

* Micro USB OTG to USB Adapter (like this [one](http://www.frys.com/product/7582626?site=sr:SEARCH:MAIN_RSLT_PG))
* 9V battery snap connector (like this [one](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/91); in my case, I soldered a 2-pin connector to a snap connector with open leads)
* 9V battery
* A USB device (I'm using the [Creative Live! Cam Sync HD 720P Webcam](http://www.amazon.com/Creative-Live-Sync-720P-Webcam/dp/B0092QJRPC/ref=sr_1_4?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1415288513&sr=1-4))

## Supplying power to the Mini breakout board

There are four primary ways to supply power to Edison using the Mini breakout board (more info can be found [here](https://communities.intel.com/docs/DOC-23252)):

* J2 (upper left)&mdash;a battery connector to supply power, such as a rechargeable Lithium Ion battery
* Micro USB port labeled J16 (2nd port from the top)&mdash;this is how the board was powered when we first set up Edison, but it can also act as a USB host
* J21 (lower right)&mdash;this is the main power input, where 7-15 VDC should be applied
* J22 (on the bottom of the board directly underneath J21)&mdash;a power jack can be soldered onto the circle and square solder pads to supply power; again 7-15 VDC should be applied

In order to use Edison as a USB host, power must be supplied externally using either J21 or J22. If you supply power with a battery on J2, it will not power the USB connector. So, let's connect a 9V battery to J21:

Make sure that the red wire is connected to the left pin and the black wire is connected to the right pin (ground). The board lights should now turn on!

## Connecting a USB device

Attach the Micro USB OTG to USB adapter to J16 and connect the USB device (I am using a webcam in this example):

Let's check if the USB device is detected. First, SSH into Edison:

```bash
  ssh root@myedison.local
```

where `myedison` is the name of your Edison.

Type `lsusb` at the prompt. This is a Linux command for displaying information about connected USB devices. Hopefully, your console output looks something like this:

```vim
root@myedison:~# lsusb
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 041e:4095 Creative Technology, Ltd
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
```

The first line shows that my Creative Cam is detected.

You should be good to go with a lot of USB devices after following these steps. However, you may need to install drivers, as well. For example, if you want to use a webcam, I highly recommend using a [UVC-compatible webcam](http://www.ideasonboard.org/uvc/), so that you can use the UVC Linux driver.

If you set up [AlexT's unofficial repository](http://alextgalileo.altervista.org/edison-package-repo-configuration-instructions.html) when [getting started with Edison](/blog/2014-10-29-getting-started-with-intel-edison-on-os-x), continue reading on; if not, please set it up, then continue.

To install the UVC driver, type:

```bash
opkg install kernel-module-uvcvideo
```

If the webcam was already plugged into the board, unplug and plug it back in to make sure the webcam is detected properly.
Verify that the webcam is detected by typing `dmesg -c`. The console output should look similar to this:

```bash
[   92.910838] hub 2-0:1.0: USB hub found
[   92.910899] hub 2-0:1.0: 1 port detected

```

Also, verify that the video device node has been created by typing `ls -l /dev/video0`:

```bash
root@eejun-edison02:~# ls -l /dev/video0
crw-rw----    1 root     video      81,   0 Nov 10 15:57 /dev/video0
```

Congratulations! You have now successfully connected a USB device!
