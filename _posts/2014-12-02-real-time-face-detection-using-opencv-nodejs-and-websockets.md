title: Real-time face detection using OpenCV, Node.js, and WebSockets

I've been meaning to play with [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) for quite some time now. To get my feet wet, I created a small demo using [node-opencv](https://github.com/peterbraden/node-opencv), which provides OpenCV bindings for Node.js, and WebSockets to capture video from a webcam and stream the processed frames to a web browser in real-time.

The source code is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/estherjk/face-detection-node-opencv). Check out the [video](https://youtu.be/v2SY0naPBFw) to see it in action.
