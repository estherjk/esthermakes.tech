A couple weeks ago, I released the latest version of [Reading Quantified](http://esthermakes.tech/reading-quantified). The biggest difference is how my reading habits are visualized: before, it was primarily focused on monthly trends and now, it's focused on annual trends.

Here's a snapshot of what it looked like before:

And here's a snapshot of what it looks like now:

The primary reason for this change is my desire to see progress over a longer period of time. Now that I've been analyzing my reading habits for over a year, seeing monthly breakdowns isn't as meaningful for me. I'm much more interested in understanding how many books I've read over the course of a year. As a result, I decided to use a horizontal bar chart to make it easy to compare by year. The bar chart is also interactive: when I click on a bar, the table is filtered for the specified year, so I can see details of the books I've read and how long it took me.

As I mentioned in my [first post](/blog/2015-11-24-introducing-reading-quantified/) on Reading Quantified, this is an active project for me, so as my needs change, the site will change! Please continue to check back and see how it evolves!
