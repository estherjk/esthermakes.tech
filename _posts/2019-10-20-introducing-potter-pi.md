Several months ago, my brother gifted me a wand after visiting the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Not wanting it to go to waste, I decided to make something with it. After some googling, I ran into a [couple open source projects](https://github.com/estherjk/potter-pi/wiki#acknowledgements), which inspired me to create my own DIY Harry Potter wand detection & spellcasting system.

Check out this [YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLptYOcdK9JEyvkCDLd1lmca2Ad2-JoiTL) to see it in action. The playlist shows the project's evolution in reverse order. It's pretty neat to see where it is now and where it first started.

For the code, see [GitHub](https://github.com/estherjk/potter-pi). For setup details, see the [Wiki](https://github.com/estherjk/potter-pi/wiki).
