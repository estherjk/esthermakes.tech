Earlier this month, I attended the Google Women Techmakers Summit and participated in an Android Things Workshop. Here's a [tweet](https://twitter.com/esthermakestech/status/970069460261355520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E970069460261355520%7Ctwgr%5Ehb_0_7%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Festhermakes.tech%2Fblog%2F2018%2F03%2F31%2Fplaying-with-android-things%2F) from that day.

My impressions so far: The integration with Android Studio is pretty nice! But, it's still a bit weird for me to write IoT code in Java. :)

Since then, I've been spending my spare time going through the codelabs. Check out my implementations on [GitHub](https://github.com/estherjk/androidthings-codelabs).
