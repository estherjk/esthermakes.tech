Recently, I was able to get my hands on a Moto 360 and decided to play with the motion sensors. So, I created a demo that displays the raw sensor data and performs simple shake and rotation detection using the accelerometer and gyroscope, respectively. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/estherjk/AndroidWearMotionSensors). Check out the [video](https://youtu.be/Yxne6YWGbE0) to see it in action.
